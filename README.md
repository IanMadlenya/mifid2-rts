An executable form of the MiFID II RTS (Regulatory Technical Standard) documents.

[MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markets_in_Financial_Instruments_Directive_2004) is EU law for the regulation of the financial industry.  The [original MiFID](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0039:EN:HTML) was introduced in 2004, and following the 2007/8 financial crisis a second version, [MiFID II](https://www.esma.europa.eu/policy-rules/mifid-ii-and-mifir), was introduced in 2014.

The regulator [ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Securities_and_Markets_Authority) have been entrusted with enacting MiFID II.  ESMA have produced documents which define what firms need to do to comply with MiFID II, a key set of which are the [RTS (Regulatory Technical Standards)](https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/2015/11/2015-esma-1464_annex_i_-_draft_rts_and_its_on_mifid_ii_and_mifir.pdf) documents.

The code in this GitHub repository implements the taxonomies defined in RTS 2 Annex 3 (page 72 of the RTS PDF) and in RTS 23 table 2 (page 469).

The hope is that we can use this code either as an example of, or as the basis of, a body of code which is a working executable model of all MiFID II Regulatory Technical Standards, together with a body of test data which can illustrate how the technical standards are intended to work in practice.
